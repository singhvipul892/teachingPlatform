   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteLintCustomCheck":
   Lint can be extended with "custom checks": additional checks implemented by
   developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages
   required by a library or a company coding style guideline.

   The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a
   performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.

   This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete
   APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.

   It may also flag issues found to be using a newer version of the API,
   meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or
   Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.

C:\Users\Vipul Singh\workspace\cursor\android\app\build.gradle.kts:13: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

    ~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ModifierParameter":
   The first (or only) Modifier parameter in a Composable function should
   follow the following rules:
   - Be named modifier
   - Have a type of Modifier
   - Either have no default value, or have a default value of Modifier
   - If optional, be the first optional parameter in the parameter list

                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "SetJavaScriptEnabled":
   Your code should not invoke setJavaScriptEnabled if you are not sure that
   your app really requires JavaScript support.

C:\Users\Vipul Singh\workspace\cursor\android\app\src\main\java\com\maths\teacher\app\ui\components\PdfDownloadSection.kt:85: Information: Prefer mutableIntStateOf instead of mutableStateOf [AutoboxingStateCreation from androidx.compose.runtime]
    var refreshTrigger by remember(pdf.id) { mutableStateOf(0) }
                                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AutoboxingStateCreation":
   Calling mutableStateOf<T>() when T is either backed by a primitive type on
   the JVM or is a value class results in a state implementation that requires
   all state values to be boxed. This usually causes an additional allocation
   for each state write, and adds some additional work to auto-unbox values
   when reading the value of the state. Instead, prefer to use a specialized
   primitive state implementation for Int, Long, Float, and Double when the
   state does not need to track null values and does not override the default
   SnapshotMutationPolicy. See mutableIntStateOf(), mutableLongStateOf(),
   mutableFloatStateOf(), and mutableDoubleStateOf() for more information.

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

C:\Users\Vipul Singh\workspace\cursor\android\app\src\main\res\mipmap-xxxhdpi\ic_launcher.png: Warning: Launcher icons should not fill every pixel of their square region; see the design guide for details [IconLauncherShape]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLauncherShape":
   According to the Android Design Guide
   (https://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/designer/material/iconography) your
   launcher icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional,
   front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that
   users perceive some depth."

   The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a
   filled square.

C:\Users\Vipul Singh\workspace\cursor\android\app\src\main\res\mipmap-anydpi-v26\ic_launcher_round.xml:2: Warning: The application adaptive roundIcon is missing a monochrome tag [MonochromeLauncherIcon]
<adaptive-icon xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "MonochromeLauncherIcon":
   If android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in your manifest, you must
   either remove the reference to android:roundIcon if it is not needed; or,
   supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the android:roundIcon
   and android:icon attribute.

   For example, if android:roundIcon and android:icon are both in the
   manifest, a launcher might choose to use android:roundIcon over
   android:icon to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed
   application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also
   specified in android:roundIcon.

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDipSize":
   Checks the all icons which are provided in multiple densities, all compute
   to roughly the same density-independent pixel (dip) size. This catches
   errors where images are either placed in the wrong folder, or icons are
   changed to new sizes but some folders are forgotten.

C:\Users\Vipul Singh\workspace\cursor\android\app\src\main\res\mipmap-xxxhdpi\ic_launcher.png: Warning: The ic_launcher.png icon has identical contents in the following configuration folders: mipmap-hdpi, mipmap-mdpi, mipmap-xhdpi, mipmap-xxhdpi, mipmap-xxxhdpi [IconDuplicatesConfig]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconDuplicatesConfig":
   If an icon is provided under different configuration parameters such as
   drawable-hdpi or -v11, they should typically be different. This detector
   catches cases where the same icon is provided in different configuration
   folder which is usually not intentional.

C:\Users\Vipul Singh\workspace\cursor\android\app\src\main\res\drawable\app_logo.jpeg: Warning: Found bitmap drawable res/drawable/app_logo.jpeg in densityless folder [IconLocation]

   Explanation for issues of type "IconLocation":
   The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such
   as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and
   consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi,
   drawable-hdpi and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent
   (for example a solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.
